Linux_Exploit_Suggester
=======================

Linux Exploit Suggester; based on operating system release number.

This program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, 
and return a suggestive list of possible exploits.  Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.

Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

This script has been extremely useful on site and in exams.  Now Open-sourced under GPLv2.

# Usage

知道内核版本号：

```bash
./Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl -k 版本号
```

不知道版本号：

```bash
./Linux_Exploit_Suggester.pl uname –r
```

获得内核版本号后，使用上一条命令并把版本号替换成你自己的。
